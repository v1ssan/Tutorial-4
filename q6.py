Problem 7: Merge Two Lists Alternately
Write a function that takes two lists and returns a new list by alternatingly combining their elements. If one list is longer, append the remaining elements at the end.

Example:
Input: list1 = [1, 2, 3], list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
Output: [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c', 'd', 'e']
